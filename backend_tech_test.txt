POST MAN - API testing tool
TECH STACK :
Node.js – runtime to execute JavaScript on the server
Express.js – to build REST APIs
In-memory storage (Map objects) – temporary storage for sprint work
Postman – API testing, validation, and manual test cases

BACKEND COMPONENTS :
1.app.js
* Starts the server
* Connects all routes and middleware
* Listens on port `3000`

2. Routes (src/routes/)
Routes decide which URL does what.
a) auth.routes.js- User authentication
* Accepts login request
* Receives username and proof
* Calls authentication service
* Returns a JWT token if login is valid

b)vault.routes.js- Encrypted vault handling
* Upload encrypted vault data
* Fetch encrypted vault data
* Update encrypted vault with version control
* Rejects invalid tokens, revoked devices, and version conflicts

c) device.routes.js- Device security
* Registers a device ID
* Revokes a device ID
* Blocks revoked devices from accessing vault

d)health.route.js- System monitoring
* Returns server health status

3. Middleware (src/middleware/)
Middleware runs before routes.
a)auth.middleware.js-Token validation
* Reads `Authorization` header
* Checks if JWT token is valid
* Blocks request if token is missing or invalid

b)device.middleware.js- Device validation
* Reads `x-device-id` header
* Checks if device is registered
* Blocks request if device is revoked

c)error.middleware.js-Error handling
* Catches server errors
* Sends clean error response
* Prevents backend crash

4. Services (src/services/)
Services handle how things work, not routing.
auth.service.js- Login verification
* Validates login proof
* Generates JWT token
* Does not store passwords

5. Storage (src/storage/)
Used instead of database for Sprint-1.
a) memory.store.js-Vault storage
* Stores encrypted vault data
* Stores vault version
* Handles version conflicts

b) device.store.js-Device tracking
* Stores registered devices
* Marks devices as revoked
* Checks revocation status
